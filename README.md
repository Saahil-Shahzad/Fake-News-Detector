# Fake News Detector - ML & NLP

A web application built with **Streamlit** that uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing techniques to detect fake news. The model is trained using popular Python libraries and deployed online for easy access.

**Live Demo**: [https://fake-news-detector-ml-nlp.streamlit.app/](https://fake-news-detector-ml-nlp.streamlit.app/)

## Features

- Input any news text and get instant prediction: Real or Fake
- NLP preprocessing pipeline with `nltk`
- Machine learning classification using `scikit-learn`
- Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
